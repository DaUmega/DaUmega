# 👋 Hey, I’m DaUmega  

💻 Offensive Cybersecurity Consultant • 🧑‍💻 Minimalist Software Developer

## 🚀 About Me  
I work at the intersection of **Offensive Security** and **Minimalistic Software Design**.  
I believe in **small codebases**, **zero bloat**, **zero unnecessary dependencies**, and solutions that are easy to understand, maintain, and deploy.

- 🔒 **Owner / Offensive Cybersecurity Consultant** at [Buster Cybersecurity Solutions](https://bustercybersec.com)  
- 🏥 Former **Cyber Security Consultant** at [ChipSoft](https://www.chipsoft.com)  
- 🎓 [**OSCP Certified**](https://www.credential.net/44399a0b-6db6-42b5-b8ed-626aeff0ffe7)  
- 💡 Freelance **full-stack dev** focused on clean, efficient, dependency-light builds

## 🛠️ What I Do  
- **Penetration Testing & Red Teaming** – find weaknesses before attackers do  
- **Secure Code Reviews** – simple, practical, clear guidance  
- **Custom Development** – fast, secure tools without the bloat  
- **Consulting & Training** – security done the straightforward way  

---

## ⚡ Philosophy  
I build things that:  
- Use **the least code possible**  
- Avoid **unnecessary libraries, frameworks, or tooling**  
- Favor **clarity over complexity**  
- Work reliably without heavy infrastructure  

**Why say many words when few do trick? Why ship many dependencies when one does job?**
