## 🛠️ What I Do  
- **Penetration Testing & Red Teaming** - spot the holes before they get picked.  
- **Secure Code Reviews** - clear feedback, nothing cryptic.  
- **Custom Development** - tools that are fast and slick.  
- **Consulting & Training** - practical, direct, and quick.

## ⚡ Philosophy  
**“Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?”**  
I ship what's lean, I ship what's slick.

Less code, less deps, less things to pick  
One tool that works beats a thousand that stick.

Purpose beats polish, small wins that stick  
Minimal footprint, maximal kick.
